PLAN

1. create a git repo
    X creating a github access token (off screen)

2. structure the project (game, RL, etc)

3. build out the game simulator
    X battle resolution skeleton
    X game loop skeleton
    X implementing refresh_shop
    X implement actions skeleton
    X combine pets
    X new pet on levelup
    X finish actions
    X finish game loop
    X finish battle resolution
    X ant effect
    X tier 1 pets
    X make a real test suite
    X tier 1 food
    X tier 2 pets
    X tier 2 food
    X fuzz testing tier 2 pets
    X tier 3 pets
    - tier 3 food
    - all the pets + effects
    - better visualization of the game
    - centralize the resolution stack
    - learn more about accurate resolution orders
    - add replays

4. create and train a reinforcement learning agent
    X make random agent functional
    X add heuristic to beat random
    - add reinforcement learning agent to beat heuristic
        - check out tf-agents, stable-baselines, rllib

5. profit

CURRENT TASK:
    - refactor events to be classes

SERIOUS BUGS:
- general concerns over resolution ordering
- HURT means took damage and didn't die

QUESTIONS:
- level 2 peacock, use up a charge out of battle, buy another peacock - does it get the charge back?
- does blowfish damage trigger when it dies? more generally, does 'hurt' imply 'not killed' everywhere
