PLAN

1. create a git repo
    X creating a github access token (off screen)
    
2. structure the project (game, RL, etc)

3. build out the game simulator
    X battle resolution skeleton
    X game loop skeleton
    X implementing refresh_shop
    X implement actions skeleton
    X combine pets
    X new pet on levelup
    - finish game loop
    - finish battle resolution
    - finish actions
    - all the pets + effects
    - better visualization of the game

4. create and train a reinforcement learning agent
    X make random agent functional
    X add heuristic to beat random
    - add reinforcement learning agent to beat heuristic
        - check out tf-agents, stable-baselines, rllib

5. profit
